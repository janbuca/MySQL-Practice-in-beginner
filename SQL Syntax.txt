            - Naming Convention.
            - Create table.
            - Define columns.
            - Normalize tables.
            - Define Data tayPe.
            - Define keys.
    SQL Languages->
        DDL(Data Definition languages)
            . CREATE- is used to create the database or it's objects (like table, index, function, views, store Procedure and triggers)
            . DROP- is used to delete objects from the database.
            . ALTER- is used to alter the structure of thr database.
            . TRUNCATE- is used to remove all records from a table, including all sPaces allocated for the records are removed.

    SQL is a standard language for 
            Storing
            ManiPulating &
            Retrieving data oin database.
    SQL stands from Structured Query Language.

What is database->
                - any collection of related data/information.

SQL CREATE DATABASE STATEMENT
    The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
        SYNTAX->
            CREATE DATABASE database_name;
SQL DROP TABLE STATEMENT
    The DROP TABLE statement is used to droP an existing table in a database.
        SYNTAX->
            DROP TABLE table_name;
SQL ALTER TABLE STATEMENT
    The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete or modify columns in an existing table.
        SYNTAX -> ADD columns
            ALTER TABLE table_name
            ADD column_name datatyPe;
        SYNTAX -> DRO columns
            ALTER TABLE table_name
            DROP column column_name;
        SYNTAX -> MODIFY column
            ALTER TABLE table_name
            MODIFY column column_name datatyPe;
SQL Constraints
    SQL Constraints are used to sPecify rules for data in a table.
        SYNTAX -> 
            CREATE TABLE table_name(
                column1 datatyPe constraint,
                column2 datatyPe constraint,
                column3 datatyPe constraint,
                ...........
            );
    Some of the constraints are
        NOT->
            Ensures that a column can't have null values.
        UNIQUE->
            Ensures that all values in a column are different.
        PRIMARY KEY->
            A combination of a Not Null & unique, uniquely identifies each row in a table.
        FORE KEY->
            Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table.
SQL INSERT INTO statement
    The insert into statement is used to insert new records in a table.
        SYNTAX->
            INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, column3,.........)
            values(value1, value2, value3,........);
SQL SELECT statement
    The SELECT statement is used to select data from database.
        SYNTAX SELECT statement->
            SELECT column1, column2, column3,........ 
            FROM table_name;
    The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct(different) values.
        SYNTAX->
            SELECT DISTINCT column1, DISTINCT column2,........
            FROM table_name;
SQL UPDATE statement
    The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in table.
        SYNTAX table_name
        SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2,.......
        WHERE condition;
SQL DELETE statement
    The DELETE statement is used to delete the existing records in table.
        SYNTAX->
            DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
SQL AND, OR & NOT OPerators.
    AND
        The AND oPerators disPlay  a record if all the conditions seParated by AND are TRUE.
    OR
        The OR oPerators disPlay  a record if any the conditions seParated by OR are TRUE.
    NOT
        The NOT oPerators disPlay  a record if the conditions(s) is NOT TRUE.
            SYNTAX AND, OR NOT->
                SELECT column1, column2,...
                FROM table_name
                WHERE condition1 And condition2 OR condition3;
SQL IN OPerators
    The In operator is used to specify multiple value in a where clause.
    The In operator shorthand for multiple OR condition.
        SYNTAX->
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table_name
            WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, value3,.....);
SQL BETWEEN operator
    The BETWEEN operator select values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text or dates.
        SYNTAX-> 
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table_name
            WHERE column_name BETWEEN Value1 AND value2;
SQL LIKE operator
    The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specify pattern in a column.
        There are two wildcards:
            1. % -represents zero, one or multiple characters.
            2. _ -represents a single characters.
                SYNTAX->
                    SELECT column1, column2,......
                    FROM table_name
                    WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
SQL UNION operator
    The UNION operator is used in a combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statement.
        SYNTAX->
            SELECT column_names
            FROM table1
            UNION SELECT column_names FROM table2;
SQL INSERT INTO SELECT statement
    The INSERT INTO SELECT statement is used coPies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
    INSERT INTO SELECT requires that data tyPes in source and target tables match.
        SYNTAX->
            INSERT INTO table2
            SELECT * 
            FROM table1
            WHERE condition;
SQL MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), AVG() & SUM() functions
    SYNTAX->MIN()
        SELECT MIN/MAX/COUNT/AVG/SUM(column_name)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;
SQL ORDER BY Keyword
    The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
        SYNTAX->
            SELECT column1, column2,......
            FROM table_name
            ORDER BY column1, column2,.......ASC|DESC;
